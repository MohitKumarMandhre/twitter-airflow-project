- ### Extracting data from Twitter
> **Tweepy** is an open source Python package that gives you a very convenient way to access the Twitter API with Python. Tweepy includes a set of classes and methods that represent Twitter's models and API endpoints, and it transparently handles various implementation details, such as: Data encoding and decoding.This Twitter API gives developers access to almost all of Twitter's functionalities like likes, retweets, tweets, etc.

- ### Use Python to extract data from API

- ### Deploying code on EC2 
> **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)** provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster.It provides a wide selection of instance types optimized to fit different use cases. Instance types comprise varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity and give you the flexibility to choose the appropriate mix of resources for your applications.

- ### Use Airflow for workflow management
> **Apache Airflow** is an open-source platform for developing, scheduling, and monitoring batch-oriented workflows. Airflow's extensible Python framework enables you to build workflows connecting with virtually any technology. A web interface helps manage the state of your workflows.It allows you to take data from different sources, transform it into meaningful information, and load it to destinations like data lakes or data warehouses.

- ### Store data into S3 bucket 
> **Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)** is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere.
